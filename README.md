# Mangatek ðŸ“”ðŸ“š

A nice shelf that registers all the Japanese and Korean mangas, webtoons, movies and animes already read or watched.

One of my first objectives when learning web development was to be able to transform my excel database to a nice online shelf so I could keep a record of all the books that I've read. So I'm really proud of this project ðŸ¥¹.

## MVP
1. Welcoming homepage
2. Once we access to the shelf, we can see the list of all works read or watched, each card contains : title, tags, picture and a CTA button.
3. You can click on one manga, and a card displays all the information about it : tags, title, foreign title,format and status
4. You can access to a list of mangas depending on a tag selection (ex: all the mangas that are in the "seinen" tag)
5. As we want to keep a record of all the mangas read gradually, you can add a new title to the shelf by filling out the form
6. You can log in

## Next version (V2)
1. Edit and delete a manga
2. Finish the favorite system
3. Finish the search bar
4. Create a user profile
5. Transform it to a API + React web app
And more...âœ¨
